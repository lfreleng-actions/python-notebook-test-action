## Implementation Details

Refer to the following Python tool documentation: [nbmake](https://github.com/treebeardtech/nbmake)

## Coverage Reports

Notebook tests and coverage reports may not play nicely together. Coverage
reports are setup in the pyproject.toml file. Certain options may cause
Notebook tests to fail. For this reason, coverage reports are not generated
by default through explicit flags/options sent to the pytest command. You can
override this behaviour (and enable coverage reports) by setting the relevant
"pytest_flags" action/input to a null/empty string.

## Notes

A wildcard search pattern under the PATH_PREFIX locates notebooks to test:

`path_prefix/**/*ipynb`

If this fails to locate any files, then the action will fail.

Parallel tests can speed up execution when large/complex notebooks are present.

Enabling INSTALL_KERNEL will invoke the following command before tests run:

```console
python -m ipykernel install --user --name [NBMAKE_KERNEL]
```

In this instance, you must set NBMAKE_KERNEL otherwise the action will fail.
